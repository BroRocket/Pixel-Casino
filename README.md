We are excited to announce the release of version 1.2 of **Pixel Casino**! This update brings several significant improvements and bug fixes, enhancing your gaming experience and preparing the codebase for future expansions. Below is a detailed overview of the changes included in this release.

### What's New in Version 1.2

#### Efficiency Improvements and Bug Fixes
- **Efficiency Enhancements**: Various functions have been optimized for better performance.
- **Betting System Fixes**: Resolved a bug in the betting system related to splitting the first hand of a hand that had already been split.
- **Modular Game Type Objects**: Prepared for the addition of new games by creating new files and making objects more modular.
- **Username Change Exception Handling**: Fixed a bug in the server-side exception raising for changing usernames.
- **Dealer Draw Logic**: Implemented logic to prevent the dealer from drawing more cards if all players bust or have blackjack.
- **Dynamic UI Elements**: Added dynamic positioning for balance text, deal, and leave buttons in the Blackjack game screen to support various screen sizes.
- **Chip/Bet Display Bug**: Fixed an issue where the chip/bet would not display while waiting for other players to ready up.
- **Turn Display Bug**: Corrected the "Your Turn" display bug which previously always indicated it was your turn if you had cards. Now, it only displays during your actual turn.
- **Hand Value Bug Fix**: Fixed a major bug in the hand value calculation function. It now correctly handles aces, adjusting their value to 1 only when necessary and preserving their higher value when it doesn't cause the hand to bust.
- **Blackjack Payouts**: Adjusted Blackjack payouts to the correct 3 to 2 ratio as in casinos.

#### Lobby System Improvements
- **Lobby ID Overhaul**: Lobby IDs are now 4-character random strings, making them more secure and harder to brute force. This required a complete revamp of the lobby ID system.

- **Textbox Cursor Addition**: Added a cursor to text boxes for better text input navigation.
- **Screen Element Transition**: Implemented a feature allowing screen elements like text boxes and buttons to transition between each other. This allows smoother page navigation using the Enter key.
- **Connection Error Handling**: Improved error handling to display an error page if the servers are down or if the user cannot connect, instead of crashing the app.

#### New Features
- **Blackjack Insurance**: Added the option to take insurance when the dealer is dealt an Ace face-up. This pays 2 to 1 if the dealer has blackjack. Now our Blackjack game offers all aspects of a typical casino Blackjack game.
- **End of Game Display**: Enhanced the end-of-game display to show not only the result but also the amount of money won or lost.
- **Game Icon Change**: Updated the game icon to a chip instead of a snake.

#### Codebase Preparation
- **Modularity Preparation**: Prepped the codebase for adding new casino games.

## Version 1.1 Update

We are excited to announce the release of **Pixel Casino** version 1.1! This update brings a host of new features, improvements, and bug fixes to enhance your gaming experience. Below is a detailed overview of what's new in this version:

### What's New in Version 1.1

#### Revamped Player Betting System
- **Enhanced Bet Storage:** Player bets system was revamped, allowing for improved handling of split hands and enabling the ability to double after splitting. This also allowed us to display your extra bets on the table.

#### Improved Lobby Displays 
- **Visual Updates:** Players can now see the bets of others, as well as indicators showing who is ready and whose turn it is during the game. We've also added other player's hand totals to your screen so no more doing math to determine your friend's hand value.
- **Dealer Speed Adjustment:** The speed of the dealer's actions has been slowed down for a more enjoyable pace. This should now allow all players to see the cards being drawn.

#### New Features
- **Balance Reset:** A feature to reset the user’s balance has been added, no more fear of going broke. This will serve as a placeholder until a fund-adding system is implemented. 
- **Blackjack Payout Adjustment:** Blackjacks after a split no longer pay 2 to 1, aligning with standard casino rules.

#### User Interface Improvements
- **Dynamic UI Elements:** All button and textbox objects now dynamically orient themselves. Their positions are updated whenever you change the game screen size ensuring a responsive and adaptable interface.

#### Bug Fixes
- **Betting Restrictions:** Major flaws that allowed betting beyond a player's bank have been fixed. Players can no longer double or split without sufficient funds. 
- **Double and Split Restrictions:** You can now double a hand when you have split! A former limitation in the game which our new betting system helped solve. The game now follows typical casino rules.

### How to Update

To update to version 1.1, simply download the latest version of the `PixelCasinoV1-1.zip` file from the release page, extract it to your desired location, and replace the previous version. Make sure the `assets` folder remains in the same directory as the game executable.
