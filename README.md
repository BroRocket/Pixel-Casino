## Version 1.1 Update

We are excited to announce the release of **Pixel Casino** version 1.1! This update brings a host of new features, improvements, and bug fixes to enhance your gaming experience. Below is a detailed overview of what's new in this version:

### What's New in Version 1.1

#### Revamped Player Betting System
- **Enhanced Bet Storage:** Player bets system was revamped, allowing for improved handling of split hands and enabling the ability to double after splitting. This also allowed us to display your extra bets on the table.

#### Improved Lobby Displays 
- **Visual Updates:** Players can now see the bets of others, as well as indicators showing who is ready and whose turn it is during the game. We've also added other player's hand totals to your screen so no more doing math to determine your friend's hand value.
- **Dealer Speed Adjustment:** The speed of the dealer's actions has been slowed down for a more enjoyable pace. This should now allow all players to see the cards being drawn.

#### New Features
- **Balance Reset:** A feature to reset the userâ€™s balance has been added, no more fear of going broke. This will serve as a placeholder until a fund-adding system is implemented. 
- **Blackjack Payout Adjustment:** Blackjacks after a split no longer pay 2 to 1, aligning with standard casino rules.

#### User Interface Improvements
- **Dynamic UI Elements:** All button and textbox objects now dynamically orient themselves. Their positions are updated whenever you change the game screen size ensuring a responsive and adaptable interface.


#### Bug Fixes
- **Betting Restrictions:** Major flaws that allowed betting beyond a player's bank have been fixed. Players can no longer double or split without sufficient funds. 
- **Double and Split Restrictions:** You can now double a hand when you have split! A former limitation in the game which our new betting system helped solve. The game now follows typical casino rules.

### How to Update

To update to version 1.1, simply download the latest version of the `PixelCasinoV1-1.zip` file from the release page, extract it to your desired location, and replace the previous version. Make sure the `assets` folder remains in the same directory as the game executable.

We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in **Pixel Casino** version 1.1. Your feedback is invaluable to us, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions!

Happy gaming!
